# Debugging in Ruby

There are two exercises in this workshop, each exercise is program that has a number of bugs. You have to find them, and fix them. You have to do this as systematically as possible:

- Tighten the loop (find the exact line the bug is coming from)

- Get visibility (use `p` to inspect everything to help you home in on the exact line)

- Once you know the one thing that is wrong, out of place, misspelled, or not giving you what you expect, try to fix it.

Wisest are they who try only one thing to fix the problem. Faffing about trying whatever occurs to you next is a recipe for development hell.

> You should not change the tests, only the code, in this exercise.

## Setup

Clone this repo, and `cd` into it.

Run `bundle install`.

Use `cd` to navigate into the relevant exercise directory.

Run the tests with `rspec`.

## Instructions

1. Start with exercise 1, record your screen as you debug the program.

2. Watch your recording, making a note of anywhere you fail to apply a debugging process (you can watch it a x2 or even x5 speed!)

3. Repeat the above steps for exercise 2.

## Hints

There are two main types of error you will see in these examples:

1. A bug in the code. This type of error means that the code won't run, and the error message will include information about the line of code causing the issue.

2. The code doesn't do what the tests expect it to. This means that the code works, but it doesn't give the output expected by the tests.

You will see both of these errors in this example. Each type of error gives a different kind of error message. Before you start to resolve a bug, try to identify it's type.
